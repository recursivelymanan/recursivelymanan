UC San Diego M.S. graduate. During my degree, I specialized in NGS processing and analysis of DNA and RNA sourced from various induced retinal cell types. Interested in all things data analysis, and skilled in many NGS platforms (single-cell, long-read, ATAC, ChIP ...). 

On my GitHub, you'll find the repo for a paper published at my lab during my time at UCSD, showcasing all of the scripts and notebooks I used to generate many of the figure panels in the paper, as well as a detailed ReadMe to help other researches reproduce the work.
