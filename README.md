UC San Diego M.S. graduate. During my degree, I specialized in NGS processing and analysis of DNA and RNA sourced from various induced retinal cell types. Interested in all things data analysis, and skilled in many NGS platforms (single-cell, long-read, ATAC, ChIP ...). On this GitHub page I have some analysis projects that I'm working on, as well as a few presentations I've done at conferences at UCSD during my undergrad.
