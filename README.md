Hello, my name is Manan (@recursivelymanan) and this is my GitHub account!
You'll find all of my ongoing projects underneath my organization, @recursivelymanan-org
  These projects include:
  - League of Legends stat tracker (utilizes Riot API)
  - Checkers 

I'm currently a student at UCSD, seeking programming internships and working on side projects in the meantime :)

You can contact me at m1chopra@ucsd.edu
